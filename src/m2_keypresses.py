# In this module, all of the _todo_ items will be in one comment because you
# will be modifying the same block of code as you go.
#
# TODO: 1. (1 pt)
#
#   First, create a tkinter window called window.
#
#   Make sure you call window's mainloop() method so your window will show up
#   when you run this module.
#
#   Once you have done this, then change the above _TODO_ to DONE.
#
#
# TODO: 2. (2 pts)
#   
#   Now, create a frame called frm_b that has a width of 50 and a height of 50.
#
#   Add a label to that frame that starts out with an empty string as its text.
#   
#   Once you have done this, then change the above _TODO_ to DONE.
#
#
# TODO: 3. (2 pts)
#
#   For this _todo_, write a function called that update() that takes two
#   parameters:
#       - lbl       <-- Label
#       - text      <-- str
#
#   This function should update the value of the text within the given label
#   to be the string that is given.
#
#   Once you have done this, then change the above _TODO_ to DONE.
#
#
# TODO: 4. (3 pts)
#
#   For this _todo_, write an event handler function to handle any keypress. In
#   the function, check if the key pressed is a number (remember that you can
#   check if a string is a digit by using isdigit() ). If the key is a number,
#   use the update() function that you defined in the previous todo to change
#   the text in the label to be the number that was pressed.
#
#   Once you have done this, then change the above _TODO_ to DONE.
#
#
# TODO: 5. (1 pt)
#
#   Now, bind your window to your event handler.
#
#   Once you have done this, then change the above _TODO_ to DONE.
